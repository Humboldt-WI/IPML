# Introduction to Python Programming for Machine Learning and AI (IPML)

Welcome to the official repository for the "Introduction to Python Programming for Machine Learning and AI" (IPML) course, offered to bachelor students at [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](http://www.hu-berlin.de) by the [Information Systems Team](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/en/Professorships/bwl/wi/standardseite-en). This repository serves as a comprehensive compilation of materials, including code samples, demonstrations, and more, which are integral to the tutorials accompanying the lecture series.

Should you be inclined towards a version of the course tailored for self-study, we encourage a visit to [Quantinar](https://www.quantinar.com/course/689/introduction-to-python-programming-for-machine-learning-ai).

For enrolled students, additional resources, updates, and discussions are available on our [Moodle course page](https://moodle.hu-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=122757).
