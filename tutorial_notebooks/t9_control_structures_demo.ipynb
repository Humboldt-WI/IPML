    "\n",
    "In Object Oriented Programming (OOP), there is generally a difference between class and type. However, since Python 3, these ideas have been merged. Traditionally, types are built-in with the original program. Primitive types are the most basic objects built in the program, like string or integer. Classes are created by users for different functions. So you can create a class, but you cannot create a type. Each time you create an object, it is called an **instance** of that class/type.\n",
    "\n",
    " **However, as mentioned, now the idea of class and type have been merged in Python 3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every data type/class has its own methods and attributes attached to it. It is very useful to get to know these as they encompass common tasks which may otherwise require you to import functions which are not actually necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods** are functions specific to the class/type of your object. **They will always use your object as its first argument, since this is done automatically by calling a method, you do not have to write this explicitly**. They can sometimes take additional arguments as well. Check the documentation of the object to see what other method arguments exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format to call one of your object's methods is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "object_name.method(possible_arguments_if_any)\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",

    "```\n",
