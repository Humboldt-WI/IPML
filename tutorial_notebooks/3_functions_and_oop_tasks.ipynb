    "Python supports a large number of functions, which perform specific tasks. We saw functions like `print( )`, `type( )`, `isinstance( )` and a few more. These are part of core Python. Python libraries like `Numpy` make available several more functions, which you can import and then use in the same way. If a function for your purpose doesn't exist, you can create your own *custom* function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the parentheses, most functions request a set of **arguments**. The arguments provide necessary input data for the function to carry out its job. The arguments can also give more details on what actions the function should take. Functions can have zero, one, or many arguments. The arguments are separated by commas. The number of arguments can be predefined or be left flexible, meaning that the call of a function at runtime decides how many arguments are provided.\n",
