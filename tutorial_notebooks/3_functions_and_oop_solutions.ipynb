    "Python supports a large number of functions, which perform specific tasks. We saw functions like `print( )`, `type( )`, `isinstance( )` and a few more. These are part of core Python. Python libraries like `Numpy` make available several more functions, which you can import and then use in the same way. If a function for your purpose doesn't exist, you can create your own *custom* function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the parentheses, most functions request a set of **arguments**. The arguments provide necessary input data for the function to carry out its job. The arguments can also give more details on what actions the function should take. Functions can have zero, one, or many arguments. The arguments are separated by commas. The number of arguments can be predefined or be left flexible, meaning that the call of a function at runtime decides how many arguments are provided.\n",

    "So the correct version of the `display_student_info` method was picked automatically based on the type of the object, `Student` or `GradStudent`. This hints at the capabilities of OOP and how they can be very useful to write code that hides implementation details (e.g., which version of a method is the right one?) and is easy to extend when requirements change (e.g., add new, more specialized classes when needed). \n",
    "These and other capabilities of OOP are extremely useful when you build your own applications, write new Python libraries, or the like. The main reason for covering it in this course, however, is that, when programming in Python, we interact with libraries that use OOP all the time. So, next time we create an object from some class, we will know what we are doing."
