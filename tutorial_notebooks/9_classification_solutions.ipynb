    "## Exercise 2: Probabilistic and discrete class prediction using the logistic regression classifier\n",
    "The above demo has introduced the method `predict_proba()`, which any `sklearn`-based classification model supports. It gives you a an $n \\times k$ array of probability predictions, where $n$ is the number of data points and $k$ is the number of classes. In our case, $k=2$. The first column of the array contains the probability of the negative class, and the second column contains the probability of the positive class. Classifiers also support a second method called `predict()`, which returns the predicted class labels. In our context these would be either 0 or 1, to denote the negative and positive class, respectively. Finally, an easy way to assess a trained classification models is to use the method `score()`. It returns the accuracy of the model, which is the proportion of correctly predicted labels. Let's explore these methods in more detail by solving the following tasks.\n",

    "In the lecture, we discussed the confusion matrix and the ROC curve as tools to evaluate classification models. We will now demonstrate how to use these tools in Python. The `sklearn` library provides several functions to evaluate the performance of a classifier. In general, functionality for model evaluation is available in the module `sklearn.metrics`.\n",

    "## Confusion matrix\n",
    "The confusion matrix of a binary classifier is a 2x2 matrix that contains four values: true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). The following image illustrates the confusion matrix and some common performance measures derived from it. \n",

    "Let us produce a confusion matrix for our logistic regression model. To that end, we make use of the class `ConfusionMatrixDisplay` from the module `sklearn.metrics`. It is a convenient way to visualize the confusion matrix and offers two interfaces. You can either pass the true and predicted labels to the method `from_predictions()` or directly pass the trained classifier together with testing data to the method `from_estimator()`. We will demonstrate both approaches using the existing variables `model` (our trained logistic regression model) as well as `X` and `y`. Before moving on, note that `sklearn` also provides function to simply calculate the confusion matrix (i.e., without visualization). To achieve this, you can use the function `confusion_matrix()` from `sklearn.metrics`."

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a single number summary of a classifier's ROC curve and a widely used indicator when comparing alternative classifiers.  \n",
