    "# A Python Powerhouse: the NumPy Library\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "*NumPy is an open source project that enables numerical computing with Python. It was created in 2005 building on the early work of the Numeric and Numarray libraries. NumPy will always be 100% open source software and free for all to use. It is released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license.* \n",

    "the NumPy library is a cornerstone of the Python ecosystem; especially for data science, machine learning, and AI. A key element is a data structure called [`nd_array`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html), which facilitates working with multi-dimensional data. Vectors, matrices, and higher order tensors (think of those as 'tables' with more than two dimensions) appear extensively in machine learning and can efficiently be stored in the NumPy nd_array. Beyond the data structure to store multi-dimensional data, the library also provides a rich set of functionality to process and manipulate the corresponding data, all of which adds to the great popularity of the NumPy library. Many other well-known and extremely popular Python libraries build on NumPy. \n",

    "The focus in this week is threefold:\n",
    "- How to use the NumPy nd_array for storing, accessing, and indexing data\n",
    "- How to use NumPy for calculating descriptive statistics and explore data\n",
    "- How to create standard charts for data visualization and understanding "

    "We need multiple data sets for this notebook, one to demonstrate things, another with which students can reproduce the demos (i.e., doing the same things on a different data set), and perhaps a third data set for having students work on tasks that go a bit beyond just appying shown concepts to a new data set\n",

    "Idea is that we created some synthetic data above and can now play with it. Focus should be on showcasing indexing. Flow can be such that we demostrate a concept using one data set (e.g., the regression data) and then ask students to repeat a steo using a different data set (e.g., classification), and finally ask them to perform a task that requires a bit more than only repeating something that we already demostrated before.\n",
