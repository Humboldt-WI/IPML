It is fine if you have not heard about this function before. To give a little bit of context, note that the Rosenbrock function  is often used as a benchmark for optimization algorithms, because it has a global minimum at (1, 1) that is surrounded by a narrow valley of high curvature. The motivation for introducing it here is that the corresponding plot looks somewhat nice. To convince yourself this is true, simply run the next code cell. Note that we collapsed the code because it might look a bit overwhelming at first glance."
